		<p> <strong>Command Line Hangman(Python) </strong> <br> Revising. This project gives the user 7 errors to guess the letters in the target word. If the user guesses a correct letter then the letter will show up in the correct position in the word, otherwise, if the guess is incorrect, one of the seven lives is subtracted and nothing happens to the display to help the user figure out the solution. This was one of my first python proejcts. I learned how to compare strings, create gameplay logic, and store the responses in an array.

		<strong>Command Line Wordle(Java) </strong> <br>This Project is a spin off of the popular game Wordle, but displayed in the command line. The user has 6 attempts to guess a 5 letter word. If the user has a correct letter in the correct position of the word, then the screen will display a capital letter in the place of where it goes. If the user has a correct letter in the incorrect position, then a lowercase letter will show on the screen. An "X" will appear as placceholders for the letters that have not been guessed correctly. This project helped me learn to

		<strong>Measures of Central Tendency with GUI(Java) </strong>  <br>This project takes an input of data (integers) from the user and calculates the measures of central tendencies of the data set when the calculate button is clicked.  The calculator first takes the data and puts it into an arrayList, then solves for the mean, # of data points, standard deviation, and variance. This project helped me learn to create and adjust ArrayLists to store Data, code calculation function, and build a GUI using JavaFX and SceneBuilder.
		<br>
		<br>

		<strong>Graphical Data Display with GUI(Java)</strong> <br>This project builds upon my Measures of Central Tendency Project by adding animation to a bar graph. An arraylist contains all of the integers that the user enters, then it calculates the measures of central tendency and adjusts the bar graph for frequency when the submit button is clicked. This project helped me learn animation with JavaFX.

		<strong> Two Player Air-hockey(Java) </strong> <br>In the process of uploading. This project is a two player air hockey game where the winner is the first one to reach 5 points. This project helped me learn how to code the physics for the ball and collisions with the paddle and gameplay functions (score and determine winner) 
		<br>
		<br>

		<strong> Single Player Air-hockey vs AI Opponent(Java) </strong> <br> This project is a single player air hockey game with an AI opponent that plays until the first player   reaches 5 points. The hashmap stores the ball's positioning on the screen and trajectory as a central data structure for my project. I based the AI to base it's movement based off of a learning factor and the positioning pulled from the hashmap. I learned a lot from this   project, such as key commands with JavaFX, storing data in hashmaps , and basic AI. </p>
